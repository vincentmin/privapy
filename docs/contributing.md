# Contributing

This is Open Source software, so [given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law). Your contributions are more than welcome.

This project is hosted on [GitHub](https://githhub.com/vincentmin/privapy) and these (common) rules apply:

- Do use the [issues tracker](https://githhub.com/vincentmin/privapy/issues).
- Let's discuss any proposed change or fix in an issue, so your work is not done in vain - I hate to reject pull requests...
- Create [pull requests](https://githhub.com/vincentmin/privapy/pulls) against `next` branch.
- Try to keep pull requests "atomic", and if possible related to an issue.
- Check code quality by running `make lint` and `make test` before submitting a pull request.
- If you add a new feature, please add tests for it.
- If you fix a bug, please add a test that would have failed before your fix.
